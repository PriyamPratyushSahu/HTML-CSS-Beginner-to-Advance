   -> Direct Application: Apply styles directly to HTML elements using the style attribute.
   -> One-off Changes: Ideal for single, unique style alterations.
   -> Can Be Cluttered: May lead to cluttered HTML if used extensively.
   -> Limited Reusuability: Reduce the reusability of CSS rules in larger projects.
