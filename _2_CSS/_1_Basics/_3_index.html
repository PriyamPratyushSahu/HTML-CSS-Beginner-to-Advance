    Inline Styles (Priority 1): Inline styles are styles applied directly to an HTML element using the style attribute. These styles have the highest specificity and will override any other styles.

    Example:
    <p style="color: red;">This text is red.</p>

    Internal and External Styles (Priority 2): Styles defined in <style> elements in the <head> section of an HTML document (internal) and styles included from external CSS files have the second-highest specificity. If there is a conflict between different internal or external styles, the one that appears later in the HTML document takes precedence.

    Example (Internal Style):

    <style>
        p {
            color: blue;
          }
    </style>
